                    <div class="mb-8">Go to your Account and click the button to link your Garmin or Wahoo profiles and follow the instructions. This will allow Strautomator to extract the sensor data from the original FIT files.</div>

                    <div class="mb-8">Keep doing your regular activities on Strava as usual. Strautomator will be parsing the FIT files and tracking the batteries of your connected sensors in the background.</div>

                    <div class="mb-8">Go to Gear to keep track of the battery level of sensors that were used in your activities.</div>

                    <p>
                        The battery tracking is integrated with exported <n-link to="/feature/calendar" nuxt>calendars</n-link>, so you will see an event whenever a sensor battery status is low or critical. Users might also opt-in to get an email
                        with a reminder to recharge or replace affected batteries.
