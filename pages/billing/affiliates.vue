            <v-alert border="top" color="accent" class="pb-0" v-if="user.isPro && !['github', 'paypal'].includes(subscriptionSource)" colored-border>
                <p>You have a PRO account already! But of course I won't mind if you keep it active and still use the links below.</p>

            <p>
                Yes! Want to try Strautomator's PRO features, but not really convinced you should spend money on a subscription yet? You can get the first year for free, by using a referral code to register to one of our affiliated fintech services.
                These are services that I personally use on a daily basis. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ul class="ml-n2">
                <li>Register using our referral link</li>
                <li>Complete the described steps</li>
                <li>Send me your Strava ID via <a href="mailto:info@strautomator.com" title="Email">email</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">Once you have completed the registration and everything is confirmed, your account will be switched to PRO.</p>
            <p>After 1 year, if you still wish to keep using PRO features, you'll need to purchase an yearly or the lifetime subscription.</p>
