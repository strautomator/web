# Self-hosting Strautomator: step-by-step setup

This guide walks you through getting your own Strautomator instance running, either on your local machine or on a VPS. Plan on 1 to 2 hours for the first setup, most of it spent registering with the required 3rd party services.

> **Heads up:** Strautomator should work fine when self-hosted, but some defaults assume the official infrastructure. This guide lists every setting you need to change, but some static pages might still point to strautomator.com.

- **[strautomator/web](https://github.com/strautomator/web)** (this repo) is the website and API.
- **[strautomator/core](https://github.com/strautomator/core)** has most of the business logic and its own default settings. It is installed as an npm dependency of the web.
- **[strautomator/functions](https://github.com/strautomator/functions)** has scheduled jobs for production. You don't need them for a local setup. See [section 9](#scheduled-jobs) for details.

The database is always **Google Cloud Firestore**, even if you run the app on a VPS somewhere else. You need a Google Cloud project, but the free tier is enough for personal use.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Node.js 20+** (26 recommended)          | Runs the app                         | Nothing enforces a version; the bundled Dockerfile uses Node 26, so that's the safest choice. Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). |
| **git** and **make**                      | Clone and run                        | On macOS, run `xcode-select --install`. On Debian/Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install git make build-essential`.                                                                                               |
| **A Strava account**                      | Login and activity data              | Any free account works.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **A Google account with billing enabled** | Firestore, Storage, Maps             | Google Maps needs a billing account. The monthly free credit covers personal use.                                                                                                                        |
| **A domain on Cloudflare** (recommended)  | Public HTTPS URL for Strava webhooks | You can skip this with a Cloudflare _quick tunnel_, a reverse proxy, or plain `localhost`. See [section 4](#4-get-a-public-https-url).                                                                   |
| **cloudflared** (recommended)             | Creates the tunnel                   | Install it with `brew install cloudflared` or [another method](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/).                                                 |

## 3. Clone the repositories

Create a root folder and clone **both** repositories as siblings. `make run` expects the core repo at `../core`.

```sh
mkdir ~/strautomator
cd ~/strautomator
git clone https://github.com/strautomator/core.git
git clone https://github.com/strautomator/web.git
```

Your folder should look like this:

```
~/strautomator/
├── core/
└── web/
```

Install the dependencies and compile the core:

```sh
cd ~/strautomator/core
npm install
make build

cd ~/strautomator/web
npm install
```

> **Using the `make update` when self-hosting.** It's a maintainer command. It needs `npm-check-updates` installed globally, bumps nearly every dependency to its latest version, and changes the package version. Use plain `npm install` to get the known-good dependency versions when installing the system on your "production" environment.

## 4. Get a public HTTPS URL

Strava pushes new activities to your instance through **webhooks**, so your instance must be reachable from the internet over HTTPS. Choose your URL before you register the services in [section 5](#5-register-on-the-required-services), because several of them ask for it.

The URL you choose becomes the `app.url` setting. **It must end with a trailing slash**, for example `https://strautomator.example.com/`.

### Option A: Named Cloudflare Tunnel (recommended)

This option gives you a stable URL on your own domain. You don't need to open ports on your router, and you don't need to manage certificates. It's also the default in development mode: when `app.tunnel` is `true`, the app runs the `./tunnel` script automatically at startup.

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare. The free plan is fine.
2. Authenticate cloudflared, create the tunnel, and add a DNS record for it:
   ```sh
   cloudflared tunnel login
   cloudflared tunnel create strautomator
   cloudflared tunnel route dns strautomator strautomator.example.com
   ```
3. The `create` command prints a tunnel ID and writes a credentials file to `~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-ID>.json`. Copy the file into the web repo:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/strautomator/web/.cloudflared
   cp ~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-ID>.json ~/strautomator/web/.cloudflared/credentials.json
   ```
4. Create `~/strautomator/web/.cloudflared/config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   tunnel: <TUNNEL-ID>
   credentials-file: .cloudflared/credentials.json
   noTLSVerify: true
   ingress: [{service: http://localhost:3000}]
   ```
5. Set `app.url` to `https://strautomator.example.com/`.

The `.cloudflared` folder is git-ignored, so the tunnel credentials won't be committed. For more details, see [Create a locally-managed tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/do-more-with-tunnels/local-management/create-local-tunnel/).

### Option B: Cloudflare quick tunnel (no domain, good for a quick test)

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

This command prints a random `https://<something>.trycloudflare.com` URL. **The URL changes every time you restart the tunnel**, and each time you'll have to update `app.url` and the Strava callback domain. Set `app.tunnel` to `false`, because this tunnel runs outside the app.

### Option C: Your own reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik...) without Cloudflare

This works, but you **must** set `api.requireCloudflare` to `false`. Otherwise every `/api`, `/auth` and `/mcp` request fails with _401 Access denied_. See [Troubleshooting](#10-troubleshooting). Also set `app.tunnel` to `false`.

### Option D: localhost only

Set `app.url` to `http://localhost:3000/`, `app.tunnel` to `false` and `api.requireCloudflare` to `false`. You can log in and use the website, but Strava **can't send webhooks** to `localhost`. New activities won't be processed automatically, and the logs will show webhook errors. This setup is only good for UI work.

## 5. Register on the required services

> **About screenshots:** third-party dashboards change often and need a logged-in account, so this guide lists the exact fields you need to fill in instead. Each section links to the official guide, which usually has up-to-date screenshots.

### 5.1 Google Cloud Platform (required)

Strautomator uses Firestore as its database, Cloud Storage for files, and the Google Maps APIs for geocoding.

**a) Create a project**

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate and create a project, for example `my-strautomator`.
2. Write down the **Project ID**. It's often different from the project name. You'll use it for the `gcp.projectId` setting.
3. Link a billing account at https://console.cloud.google.com/billing.

**b) Create the Firestore database**

1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore.
2. Click **Create database**.
3. Keep the database ID as **`(default)`**.
4. Choose **Native mode**, not Datastore mode.
5. Pick a location close to you, for example `eur3` or `nam5`.
6. Choose **production rules**. The app accesses Firestore with a service account, so client rules don't matter.

The app creates its collections automatically. In development they get a `-dev` suffix, for example `users-dev`. For background, see [Create a Firestore database](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/create-database-server-client-library).

**c) Enable the APIs**

Open each link and click **Enable**:

- Cloud Firestore API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/firestore.googleapis.com
- Cloud Storage API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/storage.googleapis.com
- Geocoding API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com
- Maps Static API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/static-maps-backend.googleapis.com
- (Optional, for Gemini AI features) Vertex AI API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com

**d) Create a service account and download its key**

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create.
2. Enter a name, for example `strautomator`.
3. Grant it these roles:
   - **Cloud Datastore User**, to read and write Firestore.
   - **Storage Admin**, because the app creates buckets and sets lifecycle rules at startup.
   - (Optional) **Vertex AI User**, for Gemini.
4. Open the service account, go to **Keys**, then click **Add key** > **Create new key** > **JSON**.
5. Save the file as **`~/gcp-strautomator.json`** in your home folder. In development the app looks for this path automatically. Anywhere else, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json`.

> Never commit this JSON key. Anyone who has it can read and write your database.

**e) Create a Google Maps API key**

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials and click **Create credentials** > **API key**.
2. Edit the key. Under **API restrictions**, select **Restrict key** and allow only **Geocoding API** and **Maps Static API**.
3. Don't add HTTP referrer restrictions, because the server also calls the Geocoding API.
4. Copy the key. You'll use it for the `maps.api.key` setting. It's **mandatory**: startup fails without it.

### 5.2 Strava API application (required)

1. Log in to Strava and open **https://www.strava.com/settings/api**.
2. Fill in the form:

   | Field                             | What to enter                                                                                                                                               |
   | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Application Name                  | Anything, for example `My Strautomator`. Don't use "Strava" in the name.                                                                                    |
   | Category                          | `Other` or `Data Importer`                                                                                                                                  |
   | Club                              | Leave empty                                                                                                                                                 |
   | Website                           | Your `app.url`, for example `https://strautomator.example.com`                                                                                              |
   | Application Description           | Anything                                                                                                                                                    |
   | **Authorization Callback Domain** | **Only the host name** of your `app.url`, with no scheme, path or port. For example `strautomator.example.com`, `abc-def.trycloudflare.com` or `localhost`. |

3. Accept the terms and create the app. Strava then asks you to upload an icon. Any square image works.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You'll use them for `strava.api.clientId` and `strava.api.clientSecret`.

Good to know:

- New Strava apps are in **single-player mode**: only the athlete who owns the app can connect. That's fine for personal use. To let friends log in, submit the app for review from the same page.
- Each Strava app can have **only one webhook subscription**. Strautomator creates and cancels it automatically. **Use a separate Strava app for each instance you run**, for example one for local and one for the VPS. Otherwise the instances keep replacing each other's webhook.
- Strava's official walkthrough, with screenshots: https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/. Webhook docs: https://developers.strava.com/docs/webhooks/.

## 6. Register on optional services

All of these services are optional. **Many of them stop the app at startup if they're enabled but their keys are missing**, so you have two choices for each one:

- Register with the service and set its keys, or
- disable it with `"<module>": {"disabled": true}`, as shown in [section 7](#7-create-your-settings-files).

| Service                         | Used for                                                        | Sign-up URL                                                     | Settings keys                                                                       | Startup check?          |

If you enable an OAuth-based integration, register these callback URLs with the provider. Replace `https://strautomator.example.com/` with your `app.url`:

- Spotify: `https://strautomator.example.com/api/spotify/auth/callback`
- Wahoo: `https://strautomator.example.com/api/wahoo/auth/callback`
- Garmin: `https://strautomator.example.com/api/garmin/auth/callback`

> On a personal instance you probably don't need PayPal or Paddle. To give yourself PRO features without payments, set your user's `isPro` field to `true` directly in Firestore (collection `users-dev` in development, `users` in production).

## 7. Create your settings files

Strautomator uses [SetMeUp](https://github.com/igoramadas/setmeup) for settings. The files support `//` comments. Files are loaded in this order, and later files override earlier ones:

1. `core/settings.json`: defaults, targeting the official production site
2. `core/settings.<NODE_ENV>.json`, for example `settings.development.json`
3. `web/settings.json` and `web/settings.<NODE_ENV>.json`, if they exist
4. **`web/settings.secret.json`**: your credentials and secrets (git-ignored)
5. **Environment variables** with the `SMU_` prefix, where each `_` separates a level. For example, `SMU_gcp_projectId` sets `gcp.projectId`, and `SMU_strava_api_clientSecret` sets `strava.api.clientSecret`.
6. **`web/settings.local.json`**: loaded **only in development**, for non-sensitive local overrides (git-ignored)

> **Important:**
>
> - `gcp.projectId` and `app.url` are validated **before** `settings.local.json` is loaded, so put them in `settings.secret.json` or in environment variables.
> - In production, `settings.local.json` is **never loaded**. Put everything in `settings.secret.json` or in environment variables.

### 7.1 Generate your secret tokens

Several settings need random values. Generate them like this:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 16   # 32 chars: use for database.crypto.key and cookie.secret
openssl rand -hex 8    # 16 chars: use for database.crypto.iv
openssl rand -hex 12   # alphanumeric: use for strava.api.urlToken and strava.api.verifyToken
```

- `database.crypto.key` must be **exactly 32 characters** and `database.crypto.iv` **exactly 16 characters**, because they're used as AES-256-CBC key and IV. The app uses them to encrypt stored OAuth tokens. **Keep them forever**: if you change them later, every stored token becomes unreadable and all users have to log in again.
- URL tokens become part of the webhook URLs, so use only letters and numbers.

### 7.2 `web/settings.secret.json`

Start from the sample:

```sh
cd ~/strautomator/web
cp settings.secret.json.sample settings.secret.json
```

Then replace its contents with the **minimal working configuration** below. It enables only the required services and disables all the optional modules, including the ones that would otherwise stop startup:

```jsonc
{
  "app": {
    // Your public URL, including the trailing slash!
    "url": "https://strautomator.example.com/"
  },
  "api": {
    // Keep true when behind Cloudflare (tunnel or proxied DNS). Set to false otherwise.
    "requireCloudflare": true
  },
  "cookie": {
    "secret": "REPLACE-WITH-openssl-rand-hex-16"
  },
  "database": {
    "crypto": {
      "key": "REPLACE-WITH-32-CHARACTERS-KEY!!",
      "iv": "REPLACE-16-CHARS"
    }
  },
  "gcp": {
    "projectId": "my-strautomator"
  },
  "maps": {
    "api": {
      "key": "YOUR-GOOGLE-MAPS-API-KEY"
    }
  },
  "strava": {
    "api": {
      "clientId": "12345",
      "clientSecret": "your-strava-client-secret",
      "urlToken": "REPLACEalnumToken1",
      "verifyToken": "REPLACEalnumToken2"
    }
  },
  // Bucket names are GLOBAL across all of Google Cloud. The defaults are already taken
  // by strautomator.com, so you MUST use your own unique names, in every environment
  // (development mode only renames the calendar and gdpr buckets).
  "storage": {
    "cname": false,
    "buckets": {
      "ai": {"name": "my-strautomator-ai"},
      "cache": {"name": "my-strautomator-cache"},
      "calendar": {"name": "my-strautomator-calendar"},
      "gdpr": {"name": "my-strautomator-gdpr"}
    }
  },
  // Skip the affiliate links server (strautomator.com only).
  "affiliates": {
    "server": {"url": null}
  },
  // Disable optional modules that stop startup when their keys are missing.
  // Remove a line once you have configured that service.
  "paypal": {"disabled": true},
  "paddlewrapper": {"disabled": true},
  "spotify": {"disabled": true},
  "lastfm": {"disabled": true},
  "wahoo": {"disabled": true},
  // Optional modules that don't stop startup but log errors without keys.
  "garmin": {"disabled": true},
  "mailer": {"disabled": true},
  "openrouter": {"disabled": true},
  "chatbase": {"disabled": true},
  "weather": {
    "weatherapi": {"disabled": true},
    "tomorrow": {"disabled": true},
    "openweathermap": {"disabled": true},
    "visualcrossing": {"disabled": true}
  }
}
```

> **Note on Paddle:** to disable Paddle, use the key **`paddlewrapper`**, not `paddle`. A module's `disabled` flag is looked up by its class name in lowercase, and the Paddle module class is `PaddleWrapper`. Its API keys still go under `paddle.api.*` (`paddle.api.key` and `paddle.webhookId` are both mandatory).

> **Known cosmetic issue:** with `affiliates.server.url` set to `null`, GearWear notification emails contain a broken affiliate link. Nothing else is affected.

To enable a service later, remove its `disabled` line and add its keys. For example, for email through Amazon SES:

```jsonc
"mailer": {
    "from": "strautomator@example.com",
    "smtp": {
        "host": "email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
        "auth": {"user": "SES-SMTP-USER", "pass": "SES-SMTP-PASS"}
    }
}
```

`settings.secret.json.sample` shows where some of the other services' keys go, but it isn't exhaustive (it's missing, for example, the Wahoo, Garmin, Last.fm and Paddle keys) and it still lists the deprecated `musixmatch` key.

### 7.3 `web/settings.local.json` (optional, development only)

Use this file for non-sensitive local tweaks:

```jsonc
{
  "app": {
    // Set to false if you run the tunnel yourself or don't use Cloudflare.
    "tunnel": true,
    // Verbose debug logging.
    "debug": false
  },
  "strava": {
    // true = don't write activity changes back to Strava, they're logged to the console instead. Great for testing recipes. (The FTP auto-update still writes.)
    "testMode": false
  }
}
```

### 7.4 (Optional) Encrypt `settings.secret.json`

The file stays in plain text by default. To encrypt it:

```sh
export SMU_CRYPTO_KEY="some-long-random-string"   # keep this safe, and set it wherever the app runs
npx setmeup encrypt ./settings.secret.json          # use `npx setmeup decrypt ./settings.secret.json` to edit it again
```

The app decrypts the file automatically at startup. If you don't set `SMU_CRYPTO_KEY`, SetMeUp uses **this machine's ID** as the key, and the encrypted file won't work on any other machine.

## 8. Run it locally

```sh
cd ~/strautomator/web
make run
```

`make run` does the following:

1. Copies `../core/lib` and `../core/settings*.json` into `node_modules/strautomator-core`, so your local core changes are used.
2. Starts the Nuxt dev server (`npm run dev`) on **port 3000**, with the scheduled jobs running in the same process. Both the frontend (`app/`) and the Nitro server (`server/`) reload automatically when you change their sources.
3. If `app.tunnel` is `true`, opens the Cloudflare tunnel.

> The Makefile also tries to copy an optional `country-linkify` package from a maintainer-only folder. **You can ignore the resulting "No such file or directory" messages.**

The first page load takes a few seconds, because Nuxt builds the frontend on demand. Watch the logs for these messages:

```
Database.init Default connection Collections suffixed with "-dev"
Storage.init Created bucket: my-strautomator-calendar
Strava.createWebhook ID 123456 https://strautomator.example.com/api/strava/webhook/...
```

Then:

1. Open your `app.url` in the browser.
2. Click **Connect with Strava** and authorize the app.
3. You should land on the dashboard. 🎉
4. Create a test automation, then upload or edit an activity on Strava. It should be processed within seconds. Set `strava.testMode` to `true` if you don't want activity changes written back to Strava yet.

**Firestore indexes:** some queries need composite indexes. The first time one of these queries runs, the logs show a `FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index` error with a link. Open the link, click **Create index**, and wait a few minutes. You only need to do this once per query.

## 9. Run it on a VPS (production mode)

Development mode is fine for a single user on a home server. For an always-on VPS, run the app in production mode.

### 9.1 Differences in production

|                              | Development                                     | Production                                                                               |

| GCP credentials              | defaults to `~/gcp-strautomator.json`           | **you must set** `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`                                        |
| `database.crypto.key` / `iv` | dev defaults exist                              | **you must set them**                                                                    |

| Scheduled jobs               | run in the app process                          | **not run**, see [Scheduled jobs](#scheduled-jobs)                                       |
| Frontend                     | built on the fly                                | must be pre-built with `npm run build`                                                   |
| Tunnel                       | started automatically if `app.tunnel` is `true` | usually a separate `cloudflared` service, but `app.tunnel` works here too                |

The `PORT` environment variable overrides the port. HTTPS can also be enabled by passing the certificate and key contents via the `NITRO_SSL_CERT` and `NITRO_SSL_KEY` environment variables.

### 9.2 Build and start

```sh
cd ~/strautomator/web
npm install
npm run build                  # build the Nuxt app (frontend + server) into ./.output
```

```sh
export NODE_ENV=production
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/strautomator/gcp-strautomator.json
npm start
```

> **The API URL is resolved at runtime**, from `app.url` in your settings (or the `SMU_app_url` environment variable, which sets the same thing). You don't need it when building the frontend, and changing it later requires no rebuild.

### 9.3 Keep it running with systemd

Create `/etc/systemd/system/strautomator.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Strautomator Web
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=strautomator
WorkingDirectory=/home/strautomator/strautomator/web
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Environment=GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/strautomator/gcp-strautomator.json
# The app URL comes from app.url in settings.secret.json. Alternatively:
# Environment=SMU_app_url=https://strautomator.example.com/
# Optional: Environment=SMU_CRYPTO_KEY=... if settings.secret.json is encrypted
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now strautomator
journalctl -u strautomator -f
```

For the tunnel, point the `ingress` in `config.yml` to `http://localhost:8080`, then install cloudflared as a service with `sudo cloudflared service install`. See the [Cloudflare docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) for details.

### 9.4 Docker (alternative)

```sh
docker build -t strautomator-web .
docker run -d --name strautomator -p 8080:8080 \
    -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/gcp.json \
    -v ~/gcp-strautomator.json:/secrets/gcp.json:ro \
    -v "$PWD/settings.secret.json":/app/settings.secret.json:ro \
    strautomator-web
```

The app URL comes from `app.url` in `settings.secret.json` (or pass it as `-e SMU_app_url=...`). The Docker image installs `strautomator-core` from GitHub, **not** from your local `../core` folder. The Makefile's `docker-build` target builds for `linux/arm64`. Use plain `docker build` to build for your own architecture.

### Scheduled jobs

Development mode runs several jobs inside the app: delayed activity processing (about every 2 minutes), calendar regeneration (about every 3 minutes), plus GearWear and cache cleanup once at startup. They only run when the `STRAUTOMATOR_CRON` environment variable is set, which the `npm` scripts behind `make run` do for you. **Production mode runs none of them.** The official site runs them as Cloud Run jobs from [strautomator/functions](https://github.com/strautomator/functions). On a VPS you have two options:

- Deploy the functions repo on your own infrastructure. Or,
- at minimum, process delayed activities on a schedule with a cron entry. The request must go through your public Cloudflare URL, so it gets past `requireCloudflare`:
  ```cron
  */5 * * * * curl -fsS "https://strautomator.example.com/api/strava/webhook/<strava.api.urlToken>/process-activity-queue" > /dev/null
  ```

## 10. Troubleshooting

To see more detail on any problem, set `"app": {"debug": true}` in `settings.local.json` (development) or `SMU_app_debug=true` (production).

## 11. Updating

```sh
cd ~/strautomator/core && git pull && npm install && make build
cd ~/strautomator/web  && git pull && npm install
```

Then restart the app (`make run`, or `sudo systemctl restart strautomator`). In production, also rerun the build commands from [9.2](#92-build-and-start).

After updating, compare your settings against `settings.secret.json.sample` and `core/settings.json`, because new optional modules may need to be disabled or configured.
